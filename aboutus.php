<h3>About Shall We Study</h3>

<p>
Shall We Study is a fun and educational application that can simplify the daily tasks of a student by providing a digital environment that allows the following tools:


Creating Study Groups 

Timetable Management 

Meeting Management inc. Room Booking

Join Study Groups

Online Chat

This application allows an individual to create a profile and input information about what and where they study; based on this information,
the app can suggest study groups available for the individual to join. Otherwise, the user can create their own study group with public or 
private restrictions (private requires the user to be accepted before joining, public is available to all users) and as admin, get access to many handy functions.

Public groups are a good way of meeting and socialising with new people that have common interests whilst staying focussed on studying. 

Meetings can be planned and monitored in relation to attendance with the added ability to see available rooms for the location of these rooms. 
These rooms can then be booked whilst the app keeps track of the amount of attendees so that the user can be sure that the booked room will have enough room. 

This is just  taster of the full potential and functionality within this app.

The application is available on two platforms: Android and Web. 


The Developers

This application was created as part of an international project (IGP 2015) where Scottish students and Chinese students worked together to produce an app that would be benefitial to both cultures, 
countries and educational environments. Study With Me was the result of this collaboration.
